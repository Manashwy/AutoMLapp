This an auto ml app, inspired from a similar app made by Nicholas Renotte. 

Uses Pandas profiling to create visualisations, PyCaret to automate the workflows
, streamlit to design the app and deploy using netlify. 

The layout of the app will be such that a user will be able to upload any csv/json/xml file
and the app should be able to do an auto ml profiling.
